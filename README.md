# This is a macro keyboard

Right now I have three buttons connected, two of them make the functions, and the third one, changes the mode. It has four modes, you know in wich mode you are because of two leds that indicate it.

I'm using an arduino mega 2560, so I'm not able to use the Keyboard library, instead I'm connecting with python and using pyautogui. I have two similar programs, the one that I'm using with the arduino mega and python (sketch_dec01a) and the one I'll be using when I buy a board compatible with the keyboard library (sketch_nov30aKEYBOARD).

I plan on adding more buttons, make some commands for windows and linux, add different functions for the buttons...
